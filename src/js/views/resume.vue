                                <p>I started my own company to pick up experience during my education as Webintegrator. During that time I got to work with optimization of webshops, and redesigning logos and social media buttons to fasten up the website.</p>

They told me I should have told them about this magical thing called a Raspberry Pi, that I had set up as a small webserver integrated perfectly with Active Directory. But I thought it was too simple, and since it wasn't in the assignment, I thought I'd fail if I did. Oh well...</p>
